### Fisherman's Challenge
- Daizo had prayed a week earlier for Divine Favor. It was with him for the salmon ladder, but not the dinghie jump.
- Kitaro made a very impressive effort, but was no match for the Warped Wall.
- Goeman saw mounted bandits pointing to the rice fields from his view at the top of the Salmon Ladder.
- Taro boasted, then embarrassed himself on the warped wall
    - Swam into the ocean to kill himself.
    - Goeman swam in and saved him, kicking and screaming
    - Kenji gave his family sword to Goeman as a reward, saying he hopes Jiro takes more after Goeman than Taro.
- Regent Shino rewards Taro with a metal fish knife for winning the Challenge.
- Yuki went up to congratulate Kitaro, but saw him getting kissed by a trollop and ran away crying.
